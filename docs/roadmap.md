# AudioTrace Roadmap

High-level milestones and ordering. Each item links to its spec in
[`docs/prd/`](./prd/README.md). Granular tasks live in GitHub Issues, not here —
this file answers *what's next and in what order*.

## Phase 0 — Foundation (current)

- [x] Repo scaffolding: packaging, `src/` layout, tests, CI, Docker
- [x] Public data contract: `CallReport` Pydantic models

- [ ] Transcription + speaker diarization (Whisper + pyannote)
- [ ] Quality signals (silence gaps, interruptions, pace, pitch — Librosa)
- [ ] Latency waterfall extraction
