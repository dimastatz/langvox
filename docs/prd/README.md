# Product Requirements (PRDs)

One spec per feature/module. Before implementing a feature, read its PRD; if
none exists, write one first. Keep PRDs small and focused — they're the source
of truth Claude Code and contributors build against.

## Conventions

- File name: `NNNN-short-slug.md` (zero-padded, incrementing).
- Each PRD starts with a status header: `Draft | Approved | In progress | Shipped`.
- Link the PRD from [`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md) under the relevant phase.
