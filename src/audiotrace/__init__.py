"""AudioTrace — structured analysis for voice-agent call recordings.

Public API:
    >>> import audiotrace
    >>> report = audiotrace.analyze("call.wav", metadata={"provider": "vapi"})

The extraction pipeline is not implemented yet; the data contract
(:class:`CallReport` and friends) is stable and lives in ``audiotrace.models``.
